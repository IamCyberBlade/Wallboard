Unfortunately, I do not have any documentation on me as it was left as company resources. Me and my colleagues Abbas Ahmed and Mukarab Ahmed worked on our own desktop PCs. We had to make a documentation guide from scratch with eachother. The goal was to input software that projected a full display of live call stats. When the PC box boots up, it would be configured to automatically log in and present the correct wallboard display. After configurations were complete. It was taped to a hanging TV in the office (Associated with Connells Group).
